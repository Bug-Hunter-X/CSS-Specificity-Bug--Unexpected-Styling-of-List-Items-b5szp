The solution involves improving the specificity of the first selector. We need to ensure both selectors have equal or higher specificity than the `#myList > li:nth-child(2)` selector.

One approach is to use the same specificity as the second selector. In this case we will change the first selector to `#myList > li:nth-child(1)`.

```css
#myList > li:nth-child(1){
  color: blue;
}

#myList > li:nth-child(2) {
  color: green;
}

```

Another solution is to use a more specific selector, for instance, using the `:first-child` pseudo-class in conjunction with a parent selector. This would result in the following:

```css
#myList > li:first-child {
  color: blue;
}

#myList > li:nth-child(2) {
  color: green;
}

```

This ensures that both list items are explicitly styled according to the intended rules, resolving the specificity conflict.
